      <h1>Games</h1>
      <p>Any form of games have been a kids escape from everything, where they can focus on something they love and enjoy life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>For me I started off with sports but with the increase in school work, I had to quit that rush of fun was lacking in life till I found out about VideoGame.</p>
      <p>I have played many game from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">hardcore COD</a> to <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki">Stardew Vally</a>. These games allow me to have fun with my friends along with give me some leisure time.</p>
      <p>These games allowed me to communicate with people that had a very diverse background than the people I would be around in real life, I made friends that knew me.</p>

      <h1>Parents</h1>
      <p>Around the time I quit sports and found other ways to have fun that did not need me to commit as much time I was rideculed with comments from my parents about video games.</p>
      <p>They told me that it would rot my brain and that it was a wast of time, my time would be better spent working on school work(I was exhausted from).</p>
      <p>To some part I guess they were right, it was a distraction from my school work and me working toward from my dream job, but i dont think they saw the benifits in games as well.</p>
